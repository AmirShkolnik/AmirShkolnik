# Junior Software Developer
### About Me

I have always had a keen interest in technology and how the world of technology works.

Over the last years, I have been primarily involved in digital marketing within the industrial (B2B) sector, programming, and web development. During this time, I have developed a strong understanding of how to create and implement effective digital strategies. I have also learned to collaborate effectively with programmers and web developers to create user-friendly and efficient web solutions.

My work experience has provided me with valuable leadership skills, strong teamwork abilities, and effective problem-solving capabilities, especially under pressure. In the logistics industry, I have managed projects, handled warehouse operations, and overseen supply chains. Additionally, my marketing roles have involved content creation, social media management, and campaign coordination.

The combination of my diverse experiences and ongoing education fuels my drive to learn and evolve. I consider myself a creative problem solver with strong analytical skills, eager to contribute to successful projects. I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the team with enthusiasm and dedication.

Full Stack Software Development Student
------------------

Over the past 7 years, I have worked as a digital marketer within the industrial (B2B) sector. During this time, I have developed a strong understanding of how to create and implement effective digital strategies. I have also learned to collaborate effectively with programmers and web developers to create user-friendly and efficient web solutions.

Now, I have chosen to further my education in web development to combine my passion for technology with my background in digital marketing. I also have practical experience in building websites and web applications. During my education, I am working on five projects, and currently, I am working on project number 4 - a full-stack web application. I am using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Agile, Python with Django, MySQL, and Postgres.

I am a quick learner and motivated individual who always strives for growth. I thrive in a creative and challenging environment where I can use my knowledge and skills to create value for both clients and companies.
